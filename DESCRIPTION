Description: Fit a quadratic regression linear model via minimize least squared loss plus penalty. 
             Several penalties are consider here including single penalty such as squared $\ell_2$ 
             norm (Ridge regression), $\ell_1$ norm (all-pairs LASSO), nuclear norm (Reduced rank 
             regression),  and also multiple penalties such as $\ell_1+\ell_\infty$, $\ell_1+\ell_2$, 
             $\ell_1+\ell_1/\ell_\infty$, $\ell_1+\mbox{nuclear~norm}$.
